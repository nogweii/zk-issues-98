Experimenting with various link syntaxes to see how
[`zk`](https://github.com/mickael-menu/zk) parses it. Hopefully this will help
debugging [issue #98](https://github.com/mickael-menu/zk/issues/98).
Tested with versions [0.7.0](https://github.com/mickael-menu/zk/releases/tag/v0.7.0) and compiled from git commit [`59b826934436`](https://github.com/mickael-menu/zk/commit/59b8269344363dca2439cb168e847aa9f35f4444).

See the experiment files:

* [Experiments One](experiments-one.xci1f.md)
* [Experiments Two](experiments-two.muimd.md)

This is what the errors look like in my editor, Neovim:
